# Pentest-Bookmarks
Database of websites that can be used by penetration testers. 

# Purpose
Every penetration tester is using his own list for reading. So why not create a list that will be accessible publicly and everyone can benefit. The purpose of this project is to create the ideal list for penetration testing activites.

# Contribution
If you know blogs and websites with similar content feel free to contribute in order to expand the lists further. Websites will be evaluated and if they offer quality content will be successfully added to the list.
